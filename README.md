Welcome to my project readme. This is a real estate company website I built using next js , tailwind and some other packages.
1 I divided my app into (main) and (details) because each one have its own layout page
2 In the layout I imported Navbar and Footer components because I will need them in all of the website
3 I made a folder in src directory called components that contains all of the components I will need
4 Inside (details) I make a folder to create a route when clicking show details in on of the real-estates
